# FashionSense AI – Review Intelligence & Return Risk Prediction

FashionSense AI is an AI-powered analytics platform that helps fashion brands analyze customer reviews, detect product issues early, and predict return risks.

By combining AWS AI services, natural language processing, and generative AI, the system transforms unstructured customer feedback into actionable product insights and recommendations.

# Problem Statement

E-commerce brands receive thousands of customer reviews across platforms. However:

- Reviews are unstructured and difficult to analyze at scale
- Customers often write in multiple languages
- Brands discover product defects only after high return rates
- Product teams lack clear insight into customer complaints

FashionSense AI solves this by converting review data into structured product intelligence.

FashionSense AI analyzes customer reviews and automatically identifies:

- Customer sentiment
- Key complaint themes
- Product dimension issues (fit, quality, comfort, etc.)
- Return risk probability
- AI-generated executive insights
- Manufacturer improvement recommendations

The result is an interactive analytics dashboard that helps brands improve product quality and reduce return costs.
